Virtual Host Configuration
==========================

The following configuration is supported:

    {
        "implements": {
            "github.com/pinf/server-js/-meta/strawman/vhost/0.1": {
                "listen": <Port>,
                "hostname": "<Hostname>",
                "errorLogPath": "<Path>"
            }
        }
    }
    
Where:

  * `<Port>` is the port to listen to for connections.

  * `<Hostname>` is the domain hostname that will point to the port.
  
  * `<Path>` is a path to a file.
